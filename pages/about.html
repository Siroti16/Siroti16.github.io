			<h3>Suspension Forks</h3>
			<div>The front suspension, or fork, takes a large majority of the rider's weight, as mountain biking sees the rider often riding with more weight over the front of the bike, when the front wheel goes over any sort of bump it will compress which takes the load making the bike feel more smooth on technical terrian</div>
			<h3>Rear Shock</h3>
			<div>Rear suspension is only found on full-suspension mountain bikes, and is commonly referred to as the rear shock, or shock for short. The shock allows the rear wheel to soak up impacts, helping to keep the tire in contact with the ground, increasing rider control and decreasing rider fatigue.</div>
			<h3>Chain Ring</h3>
			<div>Chain rings have changed recently with modern mountain bike. In earlier mountain bike designs more gears was seen as better because the can have more gear range and situational flexibility. In recent times having only one gear on the front is seen as superior because it makes it simple and easier to use, its less bulky and saves weight.</div>
			<h3> Dropper Post</h3>
			<div>Pre dropper post times riders would have to manually loosen the seat post with there hands or a specialized tool such as an allen key, but since the invention of the dropper seat post 1984 and the increase of popularity in 2015 people have been able to ride easier. Dopper seat posts allow riders to move there seat up and down with a press of a button.</div>
			<h3>Frame materials</h3>
			<div>Frame materials has always been changed more more durable or lighter materials. original frames were made of steel which is very strong but also heavy steel frames can still be found to this day but usaully on hardtails made to be as durable as possible, ALuminium alloy is Lighter than steel by alot it is strong (but not as strong as steel) it is found in most bikes. Carbon Fiber is the newest material of the main Three it is the lightest and still durable but the most expensive  by far, it can be found on top of the range bikes or racing bikes.</div>
