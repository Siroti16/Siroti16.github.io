			<h1>What is a mountian bike?</h1>
			</div>
			<div> A mountain bike is a bike designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share some similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include a suspension fork, large knobby tires, more durable wheels, more powerful brakes, straight, extra wide handlebars to improve balance and comfort over rough terrain, lower gear-ratios for climbing steep grades and sometimes rear suspension to really smooth out the trail as well as dropper-posts to quickly adjust the seat height, There are generally 3 types of Mountain bikes</div>

			<h2>Hard tail mountain bikes</h2>
			<div>Hard tail mountain bikes have a front suspension fork and a rigdet tail, they are used for cross country and light trails. They are known for being structuly strong and relyable, there are three types of hard tails, XC for track riding, trail for track and tail riding and enduro which has alot of front suspension and can be used on more technical trails</div>
			<h2>Dual Suspension</h2>
			<div>Dual Suspension bikes Have a suspension fork on the front and also a rear shock on the back this allows both wheels to have suspension so any bumbs are soaked up creating a plush ride dual suspension bikes can be put in multiple catagories, XC bikes, Trail bikes, All mountain bikes, Endro bikes and Downhill bikes</div>	
			<ol>
				<li> XC bikes- These have the lowest ammount of suspension travel ranging between 100-120mm they are used on flat tracks and ride arounds</li>
				<li> Trail bikes- These have 120-140mm of travel and are used for trails and tracks and slightly rougher terrian</li>
				<li> All mountain bikes- This is the general mountain bike being about to go on rough terrian but still be fast on climbs because they arent too heavy, they have 140-160mm travel</li>
				<li> Enduro bike- These are heavy duty used for rough sections and big technical trails and big jumps they have 160-180mm travel</li>
				<li> Downhill bikes- These bikes are made for riding downhill on any terrian they have 180-200+mm of travel they can pretty much roll over anything but they are super heavy</li>
			<h2>Rigded bikes</h2>
			<div>Rigded bikes have neither a Suspension fork or a Rear shock, they are used for off road flat trails</div>
			<h2>Soft tail</h2>
			<p>These bikes are neither hard tail or a full suspension they have the frame of a hard tail but the frame is able to flex alittle on the rear wheel so drops are softended they are used for trails and tracks</p>
